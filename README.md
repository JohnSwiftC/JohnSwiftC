# Hi there, I'm John 👋

## **About Me**

<div align="left">
  
I love all things programming, and have for a long time! I enjoy building projects from the ground up, and usually carry them out over several weeks depending on their scale and whatever features I let creep in.

Currently a freshman at Purdue University studying Computer Science, looking to get involved in as much as I can.

###  **Things I Like to Do**

- **CTFs** > Have been playing CTFs for a long time, and now I even have a team with b01lers! My strongest skills are web and binary exploitation, but I admittedly suck at cyptography challenges. *(Maybe just for now?)*
- **Bug Bounties** > A great way to test my skills and make some money doing it! Shoutout high5.id and stukent.com
- **Build Projects** > I have a pretty large scope in what I've made, from blockchain to reverse engineering tools. I build to learn!
- **Contribute to OSS** > You should too. Check out NuShell!
